Prime time - simple time tracking on CLI
=========================================

Manifest
--------

My only intention is to stay as simple as possible with this time tracker.
Sometimes I think I tried every of both FOSS and commercial ones and mostly I
hated all features, they have. Bloated, hard to setup new project task, but
printing beatifull invoices. I don't need them. All I want is to start and stop
working on something and list of all times for project for last week, month,
whatever time span I choose.

Rules
------

Use shortnames for project, best lenght for me seems three letters, but it could
be two or five for you. Also use github issue number for task naming:

    > pt start sct #23
    > pt stop
    > pt list sct week
    > pt add sct #23 23 minutes

Progress
----------

Yes this time this is only my personal proposal. There is no code yet.
